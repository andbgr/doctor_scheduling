This program generates a doctors' schedule ("Dienstplan") for a department,
with night shifts (25h or split 12.5h) and normal day shifts, based on per-day
constraints, trying to optimize for several parameters.

See the contents of the example folder for more, and Anleitung.pdf for an 
extensive how-to in German.

Requirements: you need R (https://www.r-project.org/), which works on all major
platforms, plus the xlsx package, wich can be installed inside R.
