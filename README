This script generates a doctors' schedule ("Dienstplan") for a department,
with night shifts (25h or split 12.5h) and normal day shifts, based on per-day
constraints, trying to optimize for several parameters. See example.R in the
example folder for more.

Requirements: you need R (https://www.r-project.org/) which works on all major
platforms, and the Hmisc package, wich can be installed inside R.
